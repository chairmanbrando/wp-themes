- Position Europa so its curve is cutting through the text no matter the screen size.

- Do something interesting with the site title? See: Hive salon and its SVG masking.

- Move plugin-like code out into plugins where they belong.

- Is there a real use or need for JS-copying of heading ID/name anchors? I don't use headings that often, and I don't think any of them are named at the moment. And GÃ¼ts doesn't auto-add names to them as other builder systems do.

- Figure out how to get a Wikipedia extract from a specific section should the linked URL contain a hash to one. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59511898

    So, it turns out you can't get an extract from a section. You have to do one query to find the number of sections and their metadata, match one of them up to the hash in the link, and then do a second query to get that section. Doing so will give you *all* of the contents of that section, rather than a maximum of 1200 characters as currently set for extracts, and then you have to trim it down and process it. Doesn't seem worth it, to be honest.
