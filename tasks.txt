- Tooltips need to reference the bottom of the hovered element rather than the bottom. For cases where the link text has a line break within it, hovering the line-broken part is weird because the tooltip wants to display over a portion of it.

- Certain tooltips (e.g. post #74) may have *stuff* that needs to be processed out of the returned extract's markup lest the content of the tooltip end up blank.

- Figure out how to get a Wikipedia extract from a specific section should the linked URL contain a hash to one. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59511898
